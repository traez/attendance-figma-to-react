## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript
- Nodejs (with/without Expressjs)
- MongoDB**
- GraphQL**  
- React Native**  

### What I learned

- A second Figma to React "project" for me. Better understanding of the nuances involved in the task.  
- Learned a trick to render classes without state, utilizing the "index" prop for conditional tailwind CSS class application.  
- I forgot to add the "Recommended" Tab indicator above the "Medium" option. Will refactor in future.  

### Continued development

- More projects; increased competence!
